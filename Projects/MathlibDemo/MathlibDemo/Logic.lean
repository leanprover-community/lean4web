import Mathlib.Logic.Basic -- basic facts in logic

-- Let P and Q be true-false statements
variable (P Q : Prop)

-- The following is a basic result in logic
example : ¬ (P ∧ Q) ↔ ¬ P ∨ ¬ Q := by
  -- its proof is already in Lean's mathematics library
  exact not_and_or

-- Here is another basic result in logic
example : ¬ (P ∨ Q) ↔ ¬ P ∧ ¬ Q := by
  apply? -- we can search for the proof in the library
  -- we can also replace `apply?` with its output
